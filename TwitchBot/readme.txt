Hi this is Ghostcupcake_'s twitch bot!
Before trying to run the code you have to meet the following requirements:
1.Have NodeJS install on your machine and able to run it!
2.'.env' for security layer for you bot.
3. Have the node package tmi.js (helps a lot with the work for receiveng the commands)



starting location at: 
C:\Users\user\Programming\VSProjects\TwitchBot
(That is my PC's directory, use yours!)

run command:      npm start
(start is a custom command - if you want to change the keyword go to package.json and change the command keyword(row 8))
